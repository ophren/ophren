### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a <b>Full-Stack Software Engineer</b>, experienced with JavaScript technologies. Expert in React, Redux, Node, Express, Mongo. I enjoy getting familiar with new technologies and working on ambitious projects.

I code to create great apps that make a change, to expand my understanding of complex concepts while exploring new frameworks and find solutions to challenging problems.

In my free time, I enjoy powerlifting (especially Bench Press), meeting new people and working on personal projects, mostly related to language learning, arts and coding. 

Feel free to contact me!
